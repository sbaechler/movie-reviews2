Max Borenstein and Eric Pearson manage to write an uncomplicated screenplay without absurd plot points or extremely dumb character decisions, which is all I ever asked for in this franchise, even if it carries tons of formulas and cliches. No one expects an Oscar-worthy script, but something that can serve as a companion piece to the massive battles between the Titans. Adam Wingard struggles to balance the unnecessary, irrelevant side stories that unfortunately affect the film's pacing and tone, but ultimately he's able to set up each fighting sequence nicely. Action-wise, it's the best entry of the saga, by far. From the genuinely impressive, eyegasmic CGI work to the exciting, adrenaline-pumping monster fights that will leave you at the edge of your seat, this movie is the definition of pure blockbuster entertainment. Extraordinary production value, as expected, and a perfect Junkie XL's score make this a clear recommendation.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B", "created_at": "2021-06-15T18:37:10.394Z", "id": "60c8f35648333a002a3cabf1", "updated_at": "2021-06-23T15:58:56.920Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60c8f35648333a002a3cabf1"}, {"author": "Rene", "author_details": {"name": "Rene", "username": "The_Bad_Critic", "avatar_path": "/q3zcMPYz1m7sZ8jD4ol5m6gHBQI.png", "rating": 8.0}, "content": "So after many years of flukes and alright and great movies over a decade we officially get a face off between the 2 and it kicked ass. buildings came down people died and these 2 fought a mechanical version. it is the end to a good red vs blue kinda movie.", "created_at": "2021-07-08T19:25:09.413Z", "id": "60e75115bcf8c9002f98eb38", "updated_at": "2021-07-08T23:09:56.130Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60e75115bcf8c9002f98eb38"}, {"author": "Per Gunnar Jonsson", "author_details": {"name": "Per Gunnar Jonsson", "username": "Dark Jedi", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 8.0}, "content": "I have to admit that I expected not to like this movie. When Hollywood decides to pitch two characters, whether it\u2019s superheroes or monsters, that are essentially good against each other it usually turns into crap. Take the absolutely abysmal Batman vs Superman for instance. Then we have Kong Skull Island which, while still being watchable, had a really lousy script.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise I quite liked this movie. I really got worried when the movie started off with some nutcase activist that Hollywood likes to glorify. Then they had to kiss up to Communist News Network as well by giving them some product placement. Don\u2019t use a real world news network in fiction movies please. Especially not a well known fake news and far left propaganda machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end it all turned out nicely. The nutcase activist was really a nutcase and really really annoying but he still turned out to be on the side of the good guys.\r\n\r\nThe story was not altogether bad and although this story of the hollow earth is really far out fantasy more than anything else, even more than the idea of Kong and Godzilla themselves, I liked it. It was quite cool actually and it allowed for some nice special effects other than just Godzilla and Kong beating each other up and wrecking a few cities in the process.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects. They are really why you watch these kind of movies. Sure a half decent story and passable acting helps but the special effects are the bulk of the enjoyment. For me the movie didn\u2019t disappoint in this area.\r\n\r\nThey were overall very good and actually quite balanced. Well balanced considering the kind of movie. You cannot have a Godzilla movie without at least a couple of city blocks getting demolished after all. Having an actual wet navy battleship showing up I do ascribe to the usual Hollywood writer stupidity of course but for the rest it was really cool. I especially liked the hollow earth scenes and the strange landscape with all the weird creatures.\r\n\r\nWarning, spoiler ahead: The thing I really liked with the movie was that the writers didn\u2019t go down the route of killing either Godzilla or Kong. Something I really feared and which would have reduced the movie to a rubbish rating as far as I am concerned. Instead they threw in Mechagodzilla which was quite cool albeit predictable at this point in the movie and one which united Godzilla and Kong. Also this weird, completely devoid of any (even fictional) science, link to Gidorah was quite a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\nOverall, watching this movie was two hours well spent as far as I am concerned.", "created_at": "2021-07-19T13:49:21.496Z", "id": "60f582e1af58cb002f3abb74", "updated_at": "2021-07-19T13:49:21.496Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60f582e1af58cb002f3abb74"}, {"author": "itsogs", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "itsogs", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 9.0}, "content": "If you liked the movies with Kong and Godzilla, you will enjoy this, complete with CGI and monsters against humans.

It promises a battle of epic proportions, but doesn't have the balls to give us a winner. The late introduction of Mechagodzilla is meant to give the titular characters a common enemy, allowing them to put their differences \u2013 whatever these may be \u2013 aside and work together. They want to have their cake and eat it too.\r\n\r\nThe film tries to sell us on the idea that Earth is too small for two \u201calpha titans.\u201d It doesn't occur to anyone that it might be too small for just one; then again, given that both Kong\u2019s and Godzilla\u2019s presence lacks weight, mass, volume, and depth, neither of them can be said to take up physical space on the planet (not to mention that most of the \u2018real world\u2019 surrounding them has been as unconvincingly rendered as they have).\r\n\r\nIt is, however, during an expedition to the so-called Hollow Earth that the VFX department really blows its CGI wad. There is no excess they won\u2019t indulge in, and yet it\u2019s not enough to hide the fact that Earth isn't the only hollow thing here \u2013 so is the script, which is unable to give us a single good reason why we should care about the skirmishes between a giant lizard and a giant gorilla.\r\n\r\nYou can't have two characters fight each other just because, no matter how \u2018cool\u2019 it might seem in theory; they must have a compelling motive, lest the audience loses interest in the outcome. This is such a basic concept that even the later, lesser Rocky installments understand it. But here, Godzilla and Kong just don't seem to like each other very much; even Tom and Jerry, who at least are natural enemies, have a better excuse for their enmity.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, 1) we don't know why a primate and a reptile would want to fight to the death; 2) the explanation the movie provides doesn\u2019t make sense (I mean, Hollow Earth? Puh-lease!); 3) Kong and Godzilla are so phony-looking there is never any concern that they will hurt one another, however much they try; and 4) it's a foregone conclusion that neither is going to take a dive, needed as they are for the inevitable sequels.
