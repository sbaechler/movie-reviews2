Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy.

As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx", "created_at": "2023-05-19T04:04:52.963Z", "id": "6466f564c3514c00e5dc65cd", "updated_at": "2023-05-19T04:04:53.053Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6466f564c3514c00e5dc65cd"}, {"author": "davlaga", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "davlaga", "avatar_path": null, "rating": null}, "content": "Great movie", "created_at": "2023-05-21T10:13:12.913Z", "id": "6469eeb82bcf67011bf3a715", "updated_at": "2023-05-30T14:24:10.517Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6469eeb82bcf67011bf3a715"}, {"author": "CinemaSerf", "author_details": {"name": "CinemaSerf", "username": "Geronimo1967", "avatar_path": "/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg", "rating": 6.0}, "content": "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough.

It\u2019s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I\u2019m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect \u201cFast X\u201d to be a film that\u2019s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It\u2019s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, \u201cFast Five.\u201d If you don\u2019t remember the movie, don\u2019t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He\u2019s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his \u201cfamily\u201d are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d The jokes aren\u2019t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier\u2018s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman\u2019s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in \u201cF9\u201d seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there\u2019s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom\u2019s son don\u2019t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019m a fan of all things \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. \u201cFast X\u201d feels like it\u2019s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you\u2019re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it\u2019s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:09:18.478Z", "id": "64cca41e2f266b09ef121f56", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:09:18.525Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64cca41e2f266b09ef121f56"}, {"author": "JPV852", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "JPV852", "avatar_path": "/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg", "rating": 5.0}, "content": "I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters.
