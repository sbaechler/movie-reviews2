I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.", "created_at": "2023-07-12T05:24:21.317Z", "id": "64ae3905d6590b00c7acf53f", "updated_at": "2023-07-12T05:24:21.415Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64ae3905d6590b00c7acf53f"}, {"author": "Manuel S\u00e3o Bento", "author_details": {"name": "Manuel S\u00e3o Bento", "username": "msbreviews", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 8.0}, "content": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-mi-dead-reckoning-part-one-is-a-summer-blockbuster-in-its-purest-form/\r\n\r\n\"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One delivers precisely what it set out to do: stunningly frenetic, relentless on-location action with adrenaline-charged energy levels. A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast \u2013 Hayley Atwell is outstanding \u2013 and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces.\r\n\r\nIt has the \"problem\" of being the first of two parts, with some unnatural, repetitive exposition scenes that get in the way of its progress, in addition to a somewhat generic, ambiguous narrative around A.I.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's a summer blockbuster in its purest form, as you'd expect from the icon Tom Cruise, to whom we owe our allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-", "created_at": "2023-07-15T19:26:52.558Z", "id": "64b2f2fcc8a2d400e3933e94", "updated_at": "2023-07-15T19:26:52.677Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64b2f2fcc8a2d400e3933e94"}, {"author": "Brent Marchant", "author_details": {"name": "Brent Marchant", "username": "Brent_Marchant", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 7.0}, "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I\u2019m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word \u201cpart\u201d in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s latest has a lot going for it \u2013 an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise\u2019s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one\u2019s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture\u2019s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging \u201cpart\u201d problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We\u2019ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can\u2019t exactly say I\u2019m holding my breath about it.", "created_at": "2023-07-16T01:36:35.068Z", "id": "64b349a3378062011c8b36f8", "updated_at": "2023-07-16T01:36:35.142Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64b349a3378062011c8b36f8"}, {"author": "CinemaSerf", "author_details": {"name": "CinemaSerf", "username": "Geronimo1967", "avatar_path": "/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg", "rating": 7.0}, "content": "I'm not really a great fan of Tom Cruise. Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don't let's have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the \"Forbin Project\" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of \"007\", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to \"Ethan\" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal \"Ilsa\" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered \"Grace\" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic \"Gabriel\" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in \"Fast X\" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even \"Hercule Poirot\" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It's entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.", "created_at": "2023-07-21T10:22:15.048Z", "id": "64ba5c5706f98400e1169ed0", "updated_at": "2023-07-21T10:22:15.155Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64ba5c5706f98400e1169ed0"}, {"author": "MovieGuys", "author_details": {"name": "", "username": "MovieGuys", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 6.0}, "content": "Spectacular cinematic action let down by an incoherent story and shallow characterisations. \r\n\r\nAs is almost always the case with the MI franchise, the latest offering dishes up spectacular, highly polished, explosive action. Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations. \r\n\r\nThe story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation. \r\n\r\nThe results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.\r\n\r\nIn short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.", "created_at": "2023-07-23T22:35:58.004Z", "id": "64bdab4dad50f0013b127c02", "updated_at": "2023-07-26T21:58:57.898Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64bdab4dad50f0013b127c02"}, {"author": "Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots", "author_details": {"name": "Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots", "username": "screenzealots", "avatar_path": null, "rating": 9.0}, "content": "The Tom Cruise \u201cMission Impossible\u201d franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable \u201cforgettable-ness.\u201d I\u2019ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it\u2019s almost a given that \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it\u2019s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they\u2019re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it\u2019s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there\u2019s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they\u2019re fighting \u201can enemy that\u2019s everywhere and nowhere.\u201d It\u2019s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren\u2019t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there\u2019s never a dull moment. There\u2019s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There\u2019s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he\u2019s still one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that this is a movie that\u2019s older and wiser and in turn, it\u2019s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning\u201d is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn\u2019t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it\u2019s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that\u2019ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I\u2019m awfully glad it doesn\u2019t.", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:02:36.097Z", "id": "64cca28c43cd5400add62db6", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:02:36.157Z", "url": "https://www.themoviedb.org/review/64cca28c43cd5400add62db6"}]}
