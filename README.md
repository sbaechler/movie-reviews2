# Movie Reviews
Exercise Project

This project uses [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) to build the app and [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.

Mocks are provided by [msw](https://mswjs.io/). To use the real endpoint, comment out the msw code and add the proxy config to 
webpack.json.

You can use Javascript (jsx) or Typescript (tsx).

Install the tailwind plugin in your IDE.

To start the app type `yarn dev`.
