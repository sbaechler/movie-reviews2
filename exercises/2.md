# React Exercise 2: Detail View

In this exercise you have to build the detail view and link it to the list view.

The mock always returns the same data for each id so feel free to switch to the real endpoint once the code is working.

- Load the data using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/queries) and the `getMovie` function.
  Take the id from the URL params.
- Add the back link to the detail page and the link to the detail page to the list item.
- Display a loading indicator while the movie is loading and an error message if there was an error.
