# React Exercise 1: List View

You are going to build a movie review site.

We already set up a project for you. Have a look at the
file structure and the existing code.


In the first exercise you build the list view.
Implement the code in the `MovieList` component.

- Load the data using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) and the `getMovies` function.
- Use the `MovieItem` component for the list items.
- Add the React Router [Route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) to the App component.
- Add the link to the detail page to the `MovieItem` component.
