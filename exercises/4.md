# React Exercise 4: Write a Test Case

In this exercise, you are tasked with writing a test case for the `MovieReviews` component.

Upon inspecting the code of the `MovieReviews` component, you will see that it should render the date of the review if the `updated_at` attribute is present on the review itself, and display "just now" otherwise.

Within the `MovieReviews.test.jsx` file, a test is marked as `test.todo`. This test already contains the assertion describing what it should accomplish. Your objective in this exercise is to implement it.

You can derive hints on how to proceed from the test above it, which has already been completed.

**NOTE:** The `renderComponent()` function includes an optional `customReviews` attribute, which passes the given array as a `review` prop for the `MovieReviews` component. You may need to utilize this attribute in your implementation ðŸ˜‰.

To execute the test suite specifically for this file, utilize the CLI command `yarn test MovieReviews`.
