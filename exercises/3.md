# React Exercise 3: Review Form

In this exercise you add the review form and submit it to the backend.

While you can use the mocks it is recommended to use the real backend here.

- Implement the `AddReview` component.
- Make the textarea field a fully controlled component.
- Use the `useMutation` hook from React Query and the `submitMovieReview` function.
- Create a `onSubmit` handler for the form that submits the data.
